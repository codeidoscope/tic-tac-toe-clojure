## Set up
Make sure you have Java, Clojure and Leiningen installed on your machine. These can all be installed via Homewbrew if that's your jam (there are some instructions [here](https://medium.com/@codeidoscope/keep-your-friends-close-and-your-enemies-clojure-523cf6e8de15))

## Running the programme

You can play Tic Tac Toe by running `lein run` from the command line. Just be gentle with it...

## Running the test suite

You can run the tests by running the command Â `lein spec` (or `lein spec -a` if you want the test to reload automatically after updating them).
